# Dear Delta Airlines,

I appreciate the in-flight entertainment system. I really do. But please let me quote Wikipedia regarding Sudoku puzzles:

> The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

Yet in your "Hard Mode" Sudoku puzzles, what do I find? The precondition is not met; the puzzle has many solutions; the puzzler, attempting to use his God-given sudoku-solving right to assume uniqueness, is foiled.

I had to resort to occupying my time in-flight by grumpily writing this IHaskell notebook to solve the puzzles, based on the theory that "writing a sudoku solver" is a more fun problem than "trying to solve some ill-posed sudoku instances".

This turned out to be true, but I'm still grouchy.

Signed,

A guy who is angry on the internet about sudoku
